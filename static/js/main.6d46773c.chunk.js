the house and feed him....\nhe will eat about 1/4 of his food,\nthen run back to the door\nand hop up and down,\nwagging his tail and moaning with the desire to go back.\nbig thinks this is the best weekend of the year.\nsafely inside the confines of the tent,\nlooking out from under the table\n(where a tiny, defenseless puppy can feel safe)\nhe loves to watch all the people.\nand when one stops
